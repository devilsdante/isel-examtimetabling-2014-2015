In this project, an algorithm was developed to solve the timetabling problem. It was the main objective to use the problem described in the \gls{itc2007}, and so the instances presented in this competition were used. The developed algorithm utilizes hybrid meta-heuristics, named \gls{gc}, \gls{sa}, and \gls{hc}, to try and solve the problem.\\
\\
With the use of this hybrid approach of \gls{gc}, \gls{sa}, and \gls{hc} we've reached near the results of the five finalists of the \gls{itc2007} on most of the sets. In some of the sets, we were able to be right before M\"{u}ller's results.\\
\\
The tests were compared not only with the top five contestants of the competition, but also with state-of-the-art approaches. These latter approaches were able to beat M\"{u}ller's results on most of the sets, but M\"{u}ller's approach can still get very good results on all the sets. The Muller's results contrast with some approaches that can beat their results on some sets but get much worse results on others.\\
\\
We can conclude that the \gls{sa} works as predicted, getting much better results on most of the sets when executed for much more time. Running the current approach for 12 hours, generated better results compared to M\"{u}ller's and some recent approaches.\\
\\
There are different approaches to be tested with the implemented approach in order to try to improve the results. Some new approaches may include the use of more heuristics with the \gls{sa} and \gls{hc}, like the \gls{gd}. One upgrade that must be implemented in order to get better results is editing the implemented \gls{sa} and make it able to move more than one examination at the time to allow examinations with \textit{exam\_coincidence} hard constraint to be moved.

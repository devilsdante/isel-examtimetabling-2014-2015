In this world, most of the people think that Artificial Intelligence was created to simulate human behavior and the way we humans think. Even thought people are not wrong, Artificial Intelligence was also created to solve problems that humans are unable to solve, or to solve it in a shorter amount of time, with a better solution. For example, any exhaustive search requires pretty complex algorithms (heuristics, meta-heuristics etc) with complex mathematical functions in order to find a feasible solution. Problems humans may take days to find a feasible solution, or may not find a solution at all that fits its needs, algorithms like these may deliver a very good solution in minutes, hours or days, depending on how much time the human is willing to use in order to get a better solution and not just a feasible one. \\

A concrete example is the creation of timetables for scheduling. Timetables can be used for educational purposes, sports scheduling, transportation timetabling etc. It may look like it's simple to create a timetable, but the truth is, this process normally requires following some rules in order to fit its purpose. These rules are called constraints in the timetabling subject, in which the more it has the harder it gets to create a feasible solution for the problem. In some cases, there are so many constraints in which some can be contradictory to each other, that it is needed to "relax the constraints" in order to solve the problem. \\
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The process of creating a timetable requires that the final solution follows a set of constraints. These can be divided in two groups: hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints are a set of rules which must be followed in order to get a feasible solution. In the other hand, soft constraints may be called "optional" since there is no need to follow these to get a solution, because they are not mandatory. The quality of a solution is calculated by using these soft constraints. In another words: the more soft constraints a solution follows, the better it is. This quality is based on the points (weight) of the soft constraints that that solution didn't follow, so the more points, the worse the solution. The weight of each soft constraint is set by the one that created the constraints. \\
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now that I talked a little bit about timetabling, let me specify the aim of this project. Its main is to create an examination timetable generator using ITC-2007 specifications. The solutions will be validated using a validator also created by me which specifies the quality of the solution and may do some corrections on the timetable in order to get an even better solution. It is also required that the final product may work with two test seasons which can be considered an extension to ITC-2007 formulation. In the end an (optional) Graphical User Interface will be created in order to allow the user to edit the current solution to fit the users needs and allow optimization to the edited solution. The generator will be tested using data from ITC-2007 and some actual data from six different programs presented in my university ISEL.\\

\section{Examination timetable: State of the Art}
\label{sec:sota}
In this topic we'll be writing about the state of art concerning examination timetable. Concretely, we'll be writing about why timetabling is a rather complex problem, some possible approaches on trying to solve a problem this type and some of the solutions already taken, specifically in ITC 2007.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Timetabling Problem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Timetabling is a subject that has been under investigation for more than ten years. There is no optimal solution for creating perfect timetables. Creating timetables is a process that requires complex algorithms in which search for solutions following a set of constraints, as mentioned above. These constraints can be divided into five main classes named Unary, Binary, Capacity, Event Spread and Agent constraints (REF: 2008 Rhydian Lewis)\\
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Timetabling problem may be formulated as a search or optimization problem (REF: 1999 Schaerf). Search problems consists about finding a solution that satisfies all the hard constraints, which soft constraints aren't the main goal, on contrary optimization problems are problems which tries to satisfy as most soft constraints as possible after satisfying all hard constraints. Optimization problems though are more commonly used to optimize feasible solutions obtained by using a search algorithm. The main goal consists in searching for a feasible solution which satisfies all hard constraints using a search algorithm. If the user's goal is to find the best solution possible in given time, a optimization solution may be applied to the solution given by the search algorithm.\\
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Search problems are quoted as NP-Complete (REF: NP-Complete wiki) and optimization problems are quoted as NP-Hard (REF: NP-Hard wiki) problem. Optimization problems are labeled NP-Hard because any optimization problem can be reduced to a graph coloring problem which is also NP-Hard. Graph coloring will be briefly explained later.\\
\\

\subsection{Solution approaches}
\label{subsection:SolutionsAppr}

Timetabling solution approaches may be the most difficult decision making part of the project. Considering the number of possible solution approaches that can be made, but still only a short number of those approaches may have good solutions within a reasonable amount of time. Considering the state of art, some combinations of algorithms appear to be better than others, if well implemented and optimized. These algorithms normally are divided in search algorithms and optimization algorithms in which are known as Heuristics and Meta-heuristics. Both of these can be used to generate solutions separately, but normally Heuristics are used to generate a solution not guaranteed to be optimal, but good enough to at least solve all the hard constraints. In contrary the Meta-heuristics are often only to, given a feasible solution, generate an even better optimized solution, in which the main goal is to solve the most soft constraints possible in order to get the lowest score. Heuristics though are problem-dependent, meaning that these are adapted to a specific problem in which take advantage of its details. Considering these algorithms are often greedy, they tend to get trapped on local optimum. Meta-heuristics are problem-independent, meaning they can't take advantages of specific problems. These are often not greedy so they can be used to solve (optimize) any problem given.\\
\\
Most of the Meta-heuristic algorithms used belong to one of the three categories: One-Stage algorithms, Two-Stage algorithms and Algorithms that allow relaxations. (REF: 2008 - Rhydian Lewis). The first two algorithms are worth explaining, mainly because of their usage in the state of art. The One-Stage algorithm works as Meta-heuristic algorithm(s) that is only used to get an initial optimal solution, which the goal is to satisfy both hard and soft constraints at the same time. Approaches using this are not very common because it's hard to get proper solutions in a reasonable amount of time trying to satisfy both types of constraints at the same time and this one of the reasons the Meta-heuristics are only used as optimization algorithms instead of search algorithms. The Two-Stage algorithms are the most used types of approaches because two phases (the reason for "Two-Stage" name) which the first phase consists in all soft constraints being "discarded" and focus only on solving hard constraints to obtain feasible solution. The next phase is an attempt to find the best solution, trying to solve the highest number soft constraints possible.\\
\\
Some approaches may use methods dominated \textit{exact methods} which may be viewed as tree algorithms and can be proved that it can find the optimal solution (global optimal). Exact methods search for solutions in the whole search space, and it divides the global problem into simpler problems in order to find the solution. This is not always used because these methods require a lot of computing time and it rarely produces results in a reasonable time in complex problems. For example, if the problem is complex enough it may require dozens of processors to obtain the best solution in a month of computing time. Approaches use some of these exact methods, named: Constraint Programming Based Technique, Integer Linear Programming.\\
\\
\paragraph{Constraint Programming Based Technique:}
This type of technique allows direct programming with constraints which gives ease and flexibility in solving problems like timetabling. Two important features about this technique that are used are backtracking and local variables that facilitates searching for an optimal solution (with a great cost: time). Constraint programming is different from other types of programming, as in these types it is specified the steps that need to be executed, but in constraint programming it is specified the properties (hard constraints) of the solution or properties that should not be in the solution. (REF: 2009 - Qu Burke)\\
\\
\paragraph{Integer Linear Programming:}
Integer Linear Programming is a technique in which some or all variables must be integer and the objective function and the constraints (non-integer) must be linear. Schaerf in his article specifies some approaches to school, course and examination timetabling using all integer linear programming methods to obtain feasible solutions and perform optimization (REF: 1999 - Schaerf).\\
\\
The usual approaches start with using heuristics of Graph Coloring to get an initial solution that most of the cases is a local optimum. Graph Coloring itself is not an heuristic or meta-heuristic but a method that designates a problem and its variants:\\
\\
\paragraph{Graph Coloring:}
This algorithm is divided in two main sub-types, which is vertex coloring and edge coloring. The main goal of this algorithm (vertex) is to, given a number of vertices and edges, color the vertexes so that no adjacent vertices have the same color. In this algorithm, it's best to find a solution with least colors possible. In examination timetable problem, a basic approach could be to represent the exams as vertices and the hard constraints as edges (considering this is search algorithm, it is good to use optimization algorithms to deal with soft constraints) so that exams with the same color, can be assign to the same timeslot. After coloring, it proceeds to assign the exams into timeslots considering the colors of the solution. (REF: 2009 - Qu Burke)\\
\\
Graphic Colors heuristics like \textit{Saturation Degree Ordering} are very commonly used to get the initial solutions. Others like \textit{First Fit}, \textit{Degree Based Ordering}, \textit{Largest Degree Ordering}, \textit{Incident Degree Ordering} are also heuristic techniques for coloring graphs.
\\
\paragraph{Saturation Degree Ordering:}
This heuristic is very useful because it colors the vertices with more constraints first. The coloring method is as follows: while choosing a vertice to color, the ones with higher saturation degree will be colored first. Saturation degree of one vertice can be denominated as the number of differently colored vertices adjacent to this vertice or, in another words, the number of different colors of all adjacent vertices. In case of ties, the highest saturation vertice with higher number of adjacent vertices is chosen.\\
\\
Meta-heuristics on the other hand, as mentioned above, are used to optimize first solutions. On examination timetabling Graph Coloring is used to get feasible solutions, and after that, Meta-heuristics are used to get even better solutions, optimizing the ones obtained via Graph Coloring. Some Meta-heuristics used are named \textit{Evolutionary Algorithms} [REF: Glover and Kochenberger 2003; Reeves 1993; Sastry et al. 2005], \textit{Ant Colony Optimization}[REF: (Dorigo and Blum 2005; Merkle and Middendorf 2005], \textit{Tabu Search}[REF: Gendreau and Potvin 2005; Glover and Laguna 1993], \textit{Simulated Annealing} [REF: Aarts and Korst 1989]. For more details about these Meta-heuristics (REF: 2009 - Qu Burke).\\

\subsubsection{Some approaches applied to the ITC 2007 Examination timetabling problem}
\label{subsection:ApprITC2007}

I will briefly describe some techniques used in ITC 2007 - Examination timetabling, as detailed explanations about its techniques are properly presented in its articles which will be referenced below. ITC 2007 Examination timetabling problem consists on submitting a solution which may solve all hard constraints and the quality of each solution is calculated using the soft constraints the the solution didn't solve. Each soft constraint has its weight in the problem's context, and that weight adds points to each other solution. In this case, the more points a solution has, the worse it is. Solutions with zero points are considered optimal solutions, because they were able to solve all hard and soft constraints. Each of these constraints are presented on ITC's site (REF: ITC's site) or it can be read in Tomas Muller's article as he explains each constraints, including for other educational timetabling problems, named \textit{post enrollment based course timetabling}, and \textit{curriculum based course timetabling}\\
\\

\paragraph{\textbf{Tomas Muller's approach:}}

Tomas Muller's approach was actually used to solve all three problems established by ITC 2007 competition. He was able to win two of them and be finalist on the third. For solving the problems, he opted for an hybrid approach. Meaning it has more than one algorithm working at the same time for first (construction) phase and/or for the second (optimization) phase. In this case, he chose to use multiple algorithms to optimize its first solutions.\\
\\
In the \underline{first phase}, \textit{Tomas used Iterative Forward Search} (IFS) algorithm (REF: Muller 2005) to obtain feasible solutions and \textit{Conflict-based Statistics} (Muller et al. 2004) to prevent IFS from looping. \\
\\
IFS algorithm assigns a value to one unassigned variable on each iteration. These variables are exams (in examination timetabling problem) and are only assignable if the result won't cause violations of hard constraints. If it's the case, some precautions may be applied to continue with the algorithm. An assign will result in an exam (the variable assigned) being held in a room X, time Y with Z students. The variable chosen in each iteration is randomized or parametrized to, for example, assign the most difficult assignable exam first. The Conflict-based Statistics was used to memorize some previously passed conflicts and avoid repeating those for each iteration.\\
\\
The \underline{second phase} consists in using multiple optimization algorithms. These algorithms are applied using this order: \textit{Hill Climbing}, "edited" \textit{Great Deluge} (REF: Dueck 1993) and optionally \textit{Simulated Annealing} (REF: Kirkpatrick et al. 1983).\\
\\
Hill Climbing is used to optimize the current solution only, by generating a neighbor solution each iteration. The neighbor solution is only accepted if the "score" of this solution is lower than the one we had before (only soft constraints count now) and no hard constraint is violated. If there is no better solutions for a number of iterations, which is parametrized, this algorithms stops running and the Great Deluge starts doing its job.  \\
(GREAT DELUGE??)
\\
When Simulated Annealing (SA) is used (remember that this method is optional) it is only used after Great Deluge reaches his bound lower limit. If this method is not meant to be used, Great Deluge might be used until reaches timeout or a global maximum. SA is a method similar to Hill Climbing, as it accepts neighbor solutions better than the current one. But this method also allows neighbor solutions that are worse than the current one, by establishing a mathematical operation using a variable called Temperature. The result of this operation stands for "how much wrong can the solution become" in order to avoid local maximums. This variable called Temperature is parametrized so as the Cooling Rate variable which is multiplied by the Temperature each iteration, in order to reduce the Temperature. This means that for each iteration, neighbor solutions will get less worse and it is possible to reach a local maximum again. If the local maximum is the same (solution is the same as before running Simulated Annealing), that means the maximum Temperature must get higher in order to avoid the local maximum and/or to possibly get a better solution. As the Temperature gets higher, Simulated Annealing is not repeated, but instead, Hill Climbing takes control again.

And this is the basics of Muller's approach. More detailed explanations and implementations can be viewed on his article (REF: 2009 - Thomas Muller).

Another tourist guide application with some interesting features is the GuidePal Offline City Guides~\cite{GuidePalWeb}\cite{GuidePaliPhone}. It allows users to download varied content for different cities and to consult information regarding restaurants, coffee shops, places to visit, and other attractions. Two screenshots of this application are illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:guidePalIphoneScreenshots}.\\

        \label{fig:guidePalIphoneScreenshots}
\end{figure}
\\
In order to list the existing points of interest, the user selects the desired city and category as illustrated by  Figure~\ref{fig:guidePalIphoneScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:guidePalCategorySelection}). After selecting the intended category, a description for the point of interest is presented; Figure~\ref{fig:guidePalIphoneScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:guidePalDetailedInformation}) shows the selection of the "Know the City" category.\\
\\
This application also have some augmented reality features, providing users with the possibility to map the real world (captured by the camera of the device) with the touristic attractions in real time. When the camera points to the direction where touristic locations are available near by, those are presented above the image. By selecting any of the presented locations, the user is redirected to the detail page similar to one illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:guidePalIphoneScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:guidePalDetailedInformation}).

\subsection{mTrip}
mTrip~\cite{mTrip} travel guide service is mainly used for big cities such as Paris, Berlin,  Madrid, and others. It is available as a separate application for each one of the major cities (for both iPhone and Android) and allows people to consult information regarding points of interest without an Internet connection. Figure~\ref{fig:mtripScreenshots} presents some screenshots of this application. \\
\\
Users can plan an itinerary or create guides for the cities by providing the detailed information on the touristic attractions they plan to visit. After specifying the dates for the trip, each user can manually compose his itinerary or allow mTrip to automatically generate an itinerary for the trip. When the automatic mode is chosen, one must indicate preferences for the attractions to be visited, as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:mtripScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:mTripPreferencesCustomization}). A list of points of interest is presented when the user selects a specific category, similar to those shown on Figure~\ref{fig:mtripScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:mTripTouisticLocations}).
\\

\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each point of interest is accompanied by a description, a photo, opening hour, prices, as well as the comments and ratings from other travellers. The application provides an augmented reality tool that allows to preview of the points of interest around the user's current location.
%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Triposo}
Triposo~\cite{triposo} shares similar concepts with the mTrip application. However, it includes much more countries as well as smaller cities. When one picks the country to visit, the download of information regarding the points of interest for that country starts immediately, allowing to consult this information later in offline mode. Some major cities require additional downloads due to the large amount of the points of interest and touristic attractions. For big cities, users have access to special information regarding the city guide about all sights, a list of restaurants and extended nightlife options. The application also offers a travel dashboard with currency converter, weather, and useful native language phrases. Triposo uses freely available content from different sources, such as Wikipedia~\cite{wikipedia}, Wikitravel~\cite{wikitravel}, World66~\cite{world66}, among others.\\
\\
As it is shown by the screenshot on Figure~\ref{fig:triposoScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:triposoSuggestedPointsOfInterest}), a set of suggested points of interest for Lisbon is presented along with the main navigation items. Figure~\ref{fig:triposoScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:triposoWeahtherTime}) shows the current weather and current time for Porto as well as the spelling of some Portuguese words.\\

\subsection{Foursquare}
Foursquare is a service that allows registered users to "check-in\footnote{Check-in refers to the user's action for posting his current location at a venue.}" at their current location. It is composed by both web and mobile applications for iPhone, Android and Blackberry. Users with special permission have the possibility to contribute with new locations, such as coffee shops, restaurants, sights, among others. The service was created in 2009 and in March of 2011 a new version with a recommendation engine~\cite{foursqureRecommendationEngine} was developed, for suggesting places that users might like, based on their past actions.\\
\\
In 2013 an updated version of the service was launched, where users can consult the sights nearby their current location. The map view with the recommended sights nearby users current location is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:4SqureScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:4squre2}). An example of the touristic location details is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:4SqureScreenshots}~(\subref{fig:4squre3}) where user can have the preview of the location, save it to favourites, perform the check in, among others.\\

All these applications are modern solutions for tourist guides. The Foursquare service was created in 2009, the mTrip and TouristEye in 2010, whereas the Triposo and GuidePal have been published in 2011.

\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:ftbd}
This Section introduces the simplified service architecture as well as the employed technologies used during the development of the system components. The system is mainly composed by the~\gls{rest}~\cite{RestWebber} service with a data access layer which exposes a set of endpoints\footnote{In \gls{soa}, an endpoint is the entry point to a service.} accessible by the client applications. Client applications are available as Web-based and Mobile (for iOS~\cite{ios} platforms iPhone and iPad). Figure~\ref{fig:introductioArchitecture} shows the proposed service architecture.\\
\\
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=14.8 cm]{./images/diagrams/diagram_introduction_architecture.jpg}
   \caption{Generic service architecture.}
   \label{fig:introductioArchitecture}
\end{figure}\\
\\
The service is divided into four main layers, with the following roles:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The Database layer stores information regarding points of interest, user data, among other types of data.
 \item The Service Interface is responsible for communicating with the Database layer. It makes all accesses transparent to the end client applications. This layer is mainly responsible for the data security and integrity, delivery of information in structured format, among others.
 \item The Recommender System is responsible for finding new points of interest based on the user's past actions, and to recommend these to the user. This service uses data from the database layer in order to compute recommendations.
 \item Client Applications make \gls{http} requests in order to access data from the public \gls{api}, provided by the Service Interface layer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools and Technologies}
\label{subsec:ttbuipd}
This Subsection introduces the technologies and tools used to achieve the goals of this project. We begin by describing a set of technologies related to databases, data model, and the \gls{rest} service. Then, the Web related technologies are discussed and finally we address the mobile applications.\\
\\
%%%%
For information storage, we use the MySQL~\cite{MySqlOrcale} relational database, which uses the \gls{sql} for accessing and manipulating databases. In order to facilitate the service development process, a pre-populated database was created with a few tens of points of interest.\\
\\
%%%%
The \gls{rest}~\gls{api} is developed in order to provide a single data source for client applications, including those already developed within this project and others that may appear in the future. The \gls{api} is implemented using the Java environment and Play~Framework~\cite{playFramework}.\\
\\
The Web application implementation is focused in technologies for user interface definition and structuring such as~\gls{html5}~\cite{html5},~\gls{css3}~\cite{css3} and also the JavaScript~\cite{javaScript} technology to enrich user's interactivity. The server side of the web application was developed using the Play Framework. Twitter Bootstrap~\cite{twitterBootstrap} framework was used to generate the layout with desired dynamic content, thus providing an user friendly platform.\\
\\
%\marginpar{} %%%
In the past few years, mobile devices have been used and widespread with great success, starting with Apple's iPhone launch and later with the iPad~\cite{iPadSanchez}. Both devices share the same operating system named iOS that offers a development platform for object-oriented applications. Those are written in Objective-C~\cite{ObjectiveC}\footnote{The Objective-C is a computer programming language based on C and Smalltalk. It is designed to leverage the C language with full object-oriented programming capability, through the mechanism of message passing. When in Objective-C one sends a message, its target is resolved at runtime and then it interprets the message with the receiving object~\cite{ObjectiveC}~\cite{objectiveCBook}.} using the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit). In the course of this project the targeted applications were designed taking into consideration advanced aspects of the iOS platform such as sharing code between iPhone and iPad, by means of an Universal Application~\cite{UniversalApps}.\\
\\
%\marginpar{} %%%
The development of these applications was carried out using the \gls{ide} Xcode~\cite{Xcode}.

\subsection{Core Features}

    \hline
    
    \specialcell[t]{Wanted and\\already seen} &
	Users have the possibility to create a list of locations that they intend to visit as well as access the history of already visited locations. \\ 
    \hline

	\specialcell[t]{Social component} &
    	The following features are supported:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Integration with social networks in order to encourage users to share visits with their friends;
	\item Based on the visits and mutual preferences between various users, the system recommends new places to visit that users may like. The recommendations are produced by the recommender system, using Collaborative Filtering (CF)~\cite{ibCollabrativeVSGK}\cite{AmazonRecommendGLBSJY}\cite{recommSystemPMVS} algorithms. The proposed solution is further explained in Section~\ref{sec:ocft};
	\item The service implements the social component by itself, providing the concept of the \emph{Following} and \emph{Follower} in order to establish friendship between users. Users are notified about certain actions performed by their friends.
	\end{itemize}
    \\ 
    \hline
    
    Notification system &
    Users can receive push notifications on their iOS device when someone has started to follow them. These notifications are carried out using the~\gls{apns}~\cite{apns}.\\
\hline
    
   	Login and sign up &
    Authentication and sign up through the most popular social network services, such as Facebook~\cite{FacebookLogin} and Twitter~\cite{TwitterLogin}. \\
    \hline
    
   	Back office &
    The iOS applications implements a back office system where privileged users can create or edit an existing location. They have permission to consult log information of the different service components, to analyse and correct information regarding the touristic location that were reported by other users.\\
\hline

   	Near by  &
    Preview of the sights, near by user's geographic locations. The use-case of this feature is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:useCaseFilterByLocation}.\\
\hline

   	Recommended touristic locations  &
	The service performs recommendation of the touristic locations to users, based on their past visits. The detailed illustration of this scenario is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:useCaseRecommendationLocation}.\\
\hline
    \end{longtable}
\end{center}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The use-case illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:useCaseFilterByLocation} consists in providing the user with information regarding the sights near by his/her current location.\\

\end{figure}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each step is detailed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The geographic coordinates of user's current location, are obtained through the ~\gls{gps} of the mobile device.
\item Through the service interface, users make the requests to obtain the touristic locations passing the previously obtained geographic coordinates.
\item The service interface interacts with the Data Access Layer (DAL) in order to list the touristic locations. The distance is calculated between each sight and the submitted geographic coordinates, providing the results sorted in ascending order of distance.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The recommender system is one of the most important features of the developed service. The summarised process of the recommendation system is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:useCaseRecommendationLocation}.\\

   \caption{The recommendation process.}
   \label{fig:useCaseRecommendationLocation}
\end{figure}\\
The full process of the recommendation system is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Through the service interface, the user marks new locations as visited.
\item Using the implemented DAL, the information is stored into the database.
\item The Cron Job\footnote{Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.}~\cite{cronTab} is triggered everyday at 3:00 A.M., performing the recommendation process.
\item The recommender system obtains users eligible for the new recommendations.
\item For each user, the recommender system computes a set of locations previously unseen by the user.
\item Through the DAL, the recommender service removes previous recommendations and populates the database with the new information.
\item Later, the user obtains a list of recommendations through the service interface.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
When comparing the GuideMe service with similar applications reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:sota}, it offers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item filters of unique kind that allow searching for points of interest;
	\item a friendly and usable interface for both Web and mobile applications;
	\item integration with algorithms and services that minimize human interaction during the approval process of newly inserted locations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Report Organization}
\label{sec:reportOrganization}
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. In Chapter~\ref{theory}, we introduce the background concepts and terminology of the recommender system and different collaborative filtering techniques. Chapter~\ref{implementation} approaches the proposed solution by detailing: the chosen service architecture, the integration with the~\gls{apns} service, the analysis of different frameworks for the implementation of the~\gls{dal}, and the~\gls{rest}~\gls{api}. Chapter~\ref{implementation} also includes prototypes that were initially designed before the development of the client applications.\\
\\
In Chapter~\ref{developed-work}, we describe all the developments that were made for making this project a reality. In detail, this Chapter describes the implementation aspects of the database models for both Service and Log databases, structure of the the~\gls{rest}~\gls{api} endpoints, different characteristics of the implemented recommender system, and push notification provider. We introduce the main features, as also some implementation details of the web and iOS applications. Chapter~\ref{chapter:expRsults} is devoted to the experimental results, which have guided the implementations in the correct direction. This Chapter reflects an analysis of the different recommendation system algorithms and load tests.\\
\\
We end the document with the Chapter~\ref{conclusions} by detailing the core aspects of the project and the fulfilled objectives. In order to make the service more usable and robust, as future work we present some points that should be improved in terms of security and functionalities.

\section{Our Contribution}
\label{sec:ourContribution}
We've recently submitted an article~\cite{guideMeArticle} to the 2013 Conference on Electronics, Telecommunications and Computers (CETC 2013), where we describe the main parts of this work. We believe that the developed project contribute to the evolution of tourist guide services, and promotes the effective integration of recommendation systems as a tool to easily find new interesting places to visit.
